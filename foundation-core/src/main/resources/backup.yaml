# Configuration of backup scheduling, expressed by cron expressions.
schedule:
  # Cron expression to use for the backup schedule. This is not standard cron, but rather a subset
  # that is given to us by the Quartz Scheduler. You may use http://www.cronmaker.com/ as a
  # reference to build out custom cron expressions that are compatible. It should be noted that
  # the second field is automatically added to the cron expression, as most typical cron expressions
  # do not include it.
  # Examples:
  # "0 3 * * ?"   -> every day at 3 AM
  # "0 3 ? * SUN" -> every Sunday at 3 AM
  cron: ""
